<h2>Paper Goal Shooter</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Relive the time in elementary school when you played with paper balls!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
To simulate a rubber band, the more to "pull" back, the faster the ball goes towards the goal. The goal goes faster as time hoes on
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that while the core mechanic is fun, I don't think that and nostalgia factor are enough to carry the game by itself.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Goal sprite: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/basic-soccer-pack">HERE</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I based it off my homework-3 game which used <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/physics/matterjs/simple-body">this</a>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Relive the nostalgia of playing paper ball goal by trying to get the ball into the goal while it moves!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The goal of this prototype was to see if the core mechanic was as fun as the physical prototype
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
As the game progresses and the goal gets faster, the player shoudl be able to adapt and get a better score
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The only action the player can preform is to pull the ball back and shoot it. The further the ball is pulled back the faster it travels. 30 second time limit.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
As this game is purely skill based, I expect players to get better at the game over time.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
There is no background story, just reliving nostalgia.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A quick mobile game people can play on the go
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
30 Seconds
</li>
