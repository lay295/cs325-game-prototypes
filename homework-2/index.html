<h2>Firefighter</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
A fast paced game where you put out forest fires as a park ranger
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Random level generation, and fire generation
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The hardest part of this prototype was learning how to detect when something overlays another, and how to do the tree fire animations.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You're a park ranger and pesky fires keep starting, drive around in your car to put out the fires!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
national park service ranger
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard, a lot of randomness, achiver, overhead
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Trying to see if a top down speed game with a high score would be fun
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To be able to beat their previous high score
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The actions the player can preform are moving in 4 directions with their keyboard keys, and their task is to put out fires in the forest because they're a forest ranger.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Finding effective methods to comb the forest to find the tree that has been on fire.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are just a normal forest ranger trying to put out fires. Perhaps I could change it so the main character would be smokey the bear.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This could be well suited and adapted to be a mobile game, which can be a very quick game
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1 Minute
</li>
