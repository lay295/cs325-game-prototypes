<h2>Long Cat's Adventure</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It was using one of the themes of "stretching" and combining it with a long time internet meme, long cat. The idea was inspired by a mobile game and I just brought the ideas together.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Making a cat extend wasn't the easiest thing in the world, as this is my 1st real Phaser project. Also my menu parallax is pretty cool :) I wanted to do parallax in the main game when the cat moved from platform to platform but I ran out of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned the basics of Phaser, but I still have a lot more of the API to learn. The hardest part was figuring out the stretching cat mechanic, and I had to have seperate segments of the cat in order to achive it.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Move platform to platform as a long cat who can stretch himself!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Stretching
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Mouse input, randomness, competitor, side-scroller
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This is a prototype for a mobile game, seeing if the mechanic presented would be fun to play to get a higher and higher score.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to start off pretty bad at the game, and as they get better at timing improve their score and try to get an even higher score.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can preform only 1 action, and that is to hold down their mouse until they feel that the cat is long enough to reach the next platform. If they under or over shoot it, then the cat dies and your score resets to 0. Your goal is to keep trying to reach a higher score, similar to flappy bird. As you play more you will get better and better at the timing.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The game is purely timing, there is little to no strategy involved. Perhaps power ups could be added? Or streak bonuses?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
There really is no back story, except the main character is a meme <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/longcat">Long Cat</a>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Mobile game users who are trying to kill a couple minutes at a time.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depends how long until the user gets bored, can vary from a few minutes to maybe 10 at most.
</li>
